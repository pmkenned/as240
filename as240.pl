# as240.pl: Version 1.5.2
# Assembler for 18-240
# Written by Paul Kennedy <pmkenned@andrew.cmu.edu>
# Last updated 11/9/2012
#
# Version 1.5.2 Notes - 4/22/2013
# =============================================================================
# * Hex file is now memory.hex instead of $filename.hex
#
#
# Version 1.5.1 Notes - 11/9/2012
# =============================================================================
# * my $data = lc shift; was giving a warning when the argment was left 
#   undefined (which happens when referring to a label which is yet to be
#   defined). This error didn't seem to happen before... probably this version
#   of Perl says that undefined values are not allowed for the 'lc' function
#
# Version 1.5 Notes - 8/30/2012
# =============================================================================
# * Replaced all switch statements with if/elsif blocks
# * Commented out backwards compatability feature where 0000 would be printed
#   for untouched memory addresses until the next address multiple of 16
# * No longer creates .sim file. This was nearly identical to the .list file
#   and I am going to start using .sim for simulator scripts
#
# Version 1.4.1 Notes - 8/28/2012
# =============================================================================
# * Fixed a bug where labels more than 7 characters long would have no space
#   between it and the opcode when printed in the list and sim files
#
# Version 1.4 Notes - 7/29/2012
# =============================================================================
# * Changed behavior so that when a label is put on a line with no code, the
#   label is printed to the list file on the line with the corresponding
#   address. (Previously it did not show up in the list file at all)
#
# Version 1.3 Notes - 4/13/2012
# =============================================================================
# * Fixed minor bug caused by neglecting to comment two lines for the
#   automatic insertion of STOP instruction at the end of the code.
#
# Version 1.2 Notes - 3/26/2012
# =============================================================================
# * Added support for .equ pseudo-op
# * .equ required changing label back-subtitution approach slightly; introduced
#   a new subroutine: back_sub_label. invoked after each line which defines
#   a label (done so at the beginning of the loop)
# * Added warning message for labels on LHS of .orgs
# * Removed case-sensitive pseudo-op bug
# * Removed sim file bug (didn't print memory segments with 0000 data to align
#   the lines with addresses ending in F as was done for .list files)
#
# Version 1.1 Notes - 3/19/2012
# =============================================================================
# * Added support for addsp instruction
#
# Version 1.0 Notes - 1/3/2012
# =============================================================================
# Improvements and differences from original assembler:
# * Fixed STA bug (register field in bits [5:3] was always 0 in original)
# * Detects invalidly formed constants
# * Detects repeated label definitions
# * Detects missing operands
# * Allows for labels beginning with R
# * Allows for no whitespace before instruction
# * Allows for registers to be referred to with lowercase r
# * Does not allow "sta Rd, addr"; only allows "sta addr, Rd"
# * Does not allow labels on right-hand side of .org directives
#    (this was buggy in the original anyway; does still allow labels for .dw)
# * Improved text alignment in .list files
# * Labels are allowed on the LSH as .org now (though it generates a warning
#   since the programmer probably wants it on the next line)
#
# Additional things to note:
# * Only .hex, .list, and .sim files are generated! Not .o, .bin, or .map files
#   (if anyone has a reason to need these, please implement this functionality)
# * Does not insert STOP at end automatically -- thought original as240 did this
# * Labels are still case-sensitive
# * Weird pieces of syntax such as ,, are still allowed
#
# Things to consider implementing or changing:
# * Generating .o or .bin, as mentioned above
# * -o [FILE] flag for setting output file name.
# * Make more warning messages
# * Detect constants which are almost valid and warn e.g. $12345
#
# Known Bugs:
# If any bugs are found, please contact pmkenned@andrew.cmu.edu.

# General approach:
# For each line in the assembly file, determine the hexadecimal for the line
# store this hexadecimal value in a hash keyed by address. 
# To determine the hexadecimal for a given line of source, first look up the
# instruction in a hash keyed by mneumonic. Then bitwise OR in the register
# numbers. If the instruction is long, write the constant to the next memory
# location. If a label is used, look this up in a hash keyed by label name.
# If the label has not yet been defined, take note of it and fill in this
# location later once the value of the label has been determined.
# Detect and print errors as you go along.
#
# After this process has completed, dump the result to files.
